## Step Into History with AI Magic!
 
Dive into an immersive learning experience powered by Generative AI:  
- **Learn about Generative AI technologies**. If you've wanted to understand Generative AI and the potential for your applications, you're in the right place!
 
- **Epic Time-Travel Stories**.
Dive into a fun tale, chatting with icons like Leonardo da Vinci, Ada Lovelace, or Montezuma in every lesson.
 
- **Companion App**. Chat with historical figures‚Äîyes, they speak back!  
  ![Chat with History](./character.png)  
  Check the [_app_](./app/) directory to run the [app locally](./setup.md) or use [GitHub Codespaces](./setup.md) to run it online.
 
 
- **Accessibility FTW**. Read it, hear it‚Äîaudio tags bring it to life.
 
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a comic book with code!‚Äù ‚Äî Happy User
 
## Getting Started
 
Along this course you'll find many code examples and exercises, so we encourage you to run and experiment with the code in your own copy of this repository:
 
1. Select the **Fork** button in the upper right-hand corner of the repository or select this button:
   [![Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fork-Repository-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-with-javascript/fork)
 
2. In your forked repository, select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, then **Create codespace**. This will create a preconfigured online environment for you. You'll then be able to use [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) to run the code examples and interact with LLMs for free, without any additional setup.

While GitHub Codespaces provides a quick and easy starting point you can also run the code samples [locally](./setup/README.md#Option-2-local-setup).

> [!NOTE]
> Learn more about the following [concepts](./setup/README.md):  
>
> - GitHub Codespaces - A developer machine in the cloud.
> - GitHub Models - Free access to AI models.

### üì¶ Each Lesson Includes

- A **written lesson** with an assignment and quiz.
- A short **video** to help further your learning.
- **Solutions** for each assignment and quiz.
- **Characters** you can interact with using our [companion app](./app), demonstrating Generative AI.
