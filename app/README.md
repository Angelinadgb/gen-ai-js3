## Adding audio

- Adding background audio, download the music (make sure it's royalty free). Place it in the `public/audio` folder and name it according to the `name` field in `characters.json`, for example "davinci.mp3". 
- Locate the `TODO` comment in `index.html` and uncomment the rows regarding playing background audio, should look something like so:

   ```javascript
   /*
    TODO: undo this comment once you've downloaded background music corresponding to your character
    see characters.json name field what to name a file, for example davinci.mp3
    */
    // backgroundAudio.src = `/audio/${character.name}.mp3`; // Updated to use character.name
    // backgroundAudio.volume = maxVolume;


    // backgroundAudio.play();
   ```
