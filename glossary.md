# Glossary

A comprehensive list of technical terms used throughout the lessons.

- **API**: A set of rules enabling software applications to communicate with each other, commonly used in generative AI integration.
- **Augmented Prompt**: A prompt enhanced with additional context or information to improve the relevance of AI-generated responses.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: A technique guiding models to break down complex tasks into sequential reasoning steps for better accuracies in outputs.
- **Context Window**: The amount of past input that a language model can consider when generating responses, measured in tokens.
- **CSV**: A data format consisting of values separated by commas, often used for structured data retrieval and modification.
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: A method of providing minimal examples to the model to influence its output with specific context or format.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: A cloud-based environment for coding, testing, and running applications directly from GitHub repositories.
- **JSON**: A lightweight data-interchange format used for structured information exchange between systems, including generative AI responses.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: AI models trained on large text datasets to generate human-like responses for diverse applications.
- **Maieutic Prompting**: A technique involving follow-up queries to challenge or validate AI-generated responses for accuracy and reasoning.
- **Managed Identity**: A secure cloud mechanism that provides applications with automatic authentication to access resources without managing passwords.
- **Meta Prompts**: Instructions added before a user's prompt to refine or restrict the AI's behavior and output format.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: AI functionality to process various formats like text, image, or video input and deliver diverse outputs.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment allowing developers to execute JavaScript code server-side for building scalable applications.
- **OpenAI**: A pioneering organization in AI research and APIs for language models integrated into applications for generative tasks.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The process of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models toward desired responses and behaviors.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: A technique combining retrieval-based methods with generative models for more accurate, data-grounded outputs.
- **System Message**: A prompt in conversational AI that specifies contextual boundaries or personality for the assistant.
- **TensorFlow.js**: A JavaScript-based machine learning library enabling browser and Node.js-based AI/ML applications and training.
- **Tokenizer**: A tool used to convert text into tokens, providing structure for how data is inputted or analyzed by models.
- **XML**: A markup language formatting structured data for information storage, exchange, or generative model input/output.
