### ❓ Question 1:

### What's a benefit of adding an LLM to the client?

<details>
  <summary>✅ Answer</summary>

   * **B. Creates a more natural conversation between user and server.**

   While it's easier to maintain the client and the server by separating responsibilities, the great value of having the LLM on the client is that the user doesn't have to explicitly invoke server capabilities but can in a more seamless way either receive generic LLM responses or responses from an MCP Server.
