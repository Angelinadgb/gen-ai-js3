## MCP Server with SSE, when the server is not on your local machine

TODO

_In the context of model protocols, stdio and sse refer to different methods of communication between a client and a server. Let's break down the differences:

stdio (Standard Input/Output)
Usage: Typically used for local servers or processes running on your machine.
Communication: Involves reading from standard input (stdin) and writing to standard output (stdout).
Implementation: Often simpler and more direct, suitable for scenarios where the client and server are on the same machine.
Example: Running a local script that processes data and outputs results directly to the terminal.
sse (Server-Sent Events)
Usage: Commonly used for servers that run remotely, such as web servers.
Communication: Involves sending events from the server to the client over HTTP.
Implementation: Allows for real-time updates and continuous data streams from the server to the client.
Example: A web application that receives live updates from a remote server, such as stock prices or chat messages.
Comparison
Location: stdio is generally for local processes, while sse is for remote servers.
Data Flow: stdio is synchronous and direct, whereas sse is asynchronous and event-driven.
Use Case: stdio is suitable for simple, local tasks; sse is ideal for real-time, remote communication.
Fairness of the Statement
It is fair to say that stdio is typically used for servers meant to run on your machine, and sse is used for servers that run elsewhere. However, the choice between stdio and sse also depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for real-time updates or the simplicity of implementation.

Would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspect of these protocols or explore how they are implemented in different scenarios?_
