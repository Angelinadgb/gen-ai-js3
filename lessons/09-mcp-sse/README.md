## Lesson 9: MCP Server with SSE

In our previous lessons on MCP, we learned how to create an MCP Server, a client and we were introduced to some tooling that make developing things for MCP protocol a bit easier. Additionally we learned to improve the client with an LLM. So far, you've been using stdio as transport for your server, but in reality a server may run anywhere on a specific URL for example. For this type of situation there's another transport SSE.

In this chapter you will learn to:

- Create an MCP Server using the SSE transport. 
- Learn to test said server with our Inspector tool.
- Consume an SSE server using Visual Studio Code.

## Setup

If you haven't already, set up your development environment. Here's how you can do it: [Setup your environment](/docs/setup/README.md).

## Narrative: Guardians of time

> [!NOTE] 
> _Our story so far. You are a mechanic from 1860s London. You were working on your automaton and received a letter from Charles Babbage that ended up taking you to a library where you picked up a time travel device. Throughout your travels in time you've ended up in Florence, where you met Leonardo Da Vinci. You also went to the Aztec empire and this is where the story continues._

> See [Lesson 1](../01-intro-to-genai/README.md) if you want to catch up with the story from the beginning.

> While we recommend going through the story (it's fun!), [click here](#interact-with-hypatia) if you'd prefer to jump straight to the technical content.

TODO: returning to Ada's mansion, this time for a secret meeting and you start understanding what this is really about to guard time to ensure humanity makes it.. They do need to do the following next 1) retrieve important info from library in Alexandria 2) Recruit Hypatia 3) ensure Time Beetles can talk to each other, i.e use SSE

**Steps**:

1. Start a [![GitHub Codespace](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Codespace-brightgreen)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/generative-ai-with-javascript)
2. Navigate to _/app_ in the repo root.
3. Locate the console and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
4. Once it appears, select the "Open in Browser" button.
5. Chat with Hypatia.
