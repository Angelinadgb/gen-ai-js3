## Script

Welcome to this new session series!

You've probably figured out that this series is all about generative AI but with a little twist. We'll talk about AI with a focus on using it to create applications using JavaScript.

It might sound a bit strange to you to do AI with JavaScript. Everyone knows that the language for AI is Python, right? While it's true that Python is probably the best language to create, train, and fine-tune AI models, it's a different story when it's a matter of creating applications using these AI models. Most AI models are consumed using web APIs. That means that any language that can make HTTP calls can actually do AI.

So why JavaScript in particular here? It's a good choice for many reasons. First, because it's cross-platform and it provides seamless integration between the browser and server-side environments. So it's easy to create applications that run on the web, mobile, or desktop along with a server API to support it. It also has a very rich ecosystem of libraries, including very popular ones in the AI space, such as LangChain.js. It's ideal to consume HTTP APIs from different systems thanks to its native support for asynchronous programming.

JavaScript has one of the largest and most active developer communities in the world, meaning it's easy to find resources like open-source projects, tutorials, documentation, and forums that provide support for developers. And thanks to that, you'll never be alone while troubleshooting your issues. So yes, JavaScript is a great choice for AI, and in any case, the best language to use when you want to develop an application is the one you already know.

We'll cover many topics in this series, starting with the basics along with examples and demos all the way up to deployment in production. And we'll give many tips and best practices with every video focused on a specific topic. So feel free to either watch this series as a course or jump straight to the topic you're most interested in.

And if you're looking for more in-depth knowledge on how to develop for specific use cases, we have an example support chatbot application based on company data. We'll cover all the steps of its development from the beginning up to the deployment on Azure. 

In the next session, we'll start with the essential things that you need to know when you're working with LLMs.
